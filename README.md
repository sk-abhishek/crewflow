# CrewFlow

CrewFlow is a modern dance crew management web app designed for choreographers and dancers to manage rehearsals, projects, shoots, and health tracking.

## Why I Built This
As a dancer, I experienced how difficult it is to manage rehearsals, track attendance, coordinate shoots, and monitor recovery using scattered tools like WhatsApp and Google Docs.

CrewFlow aims to centralise these workflows into one clean, dancer-focused platform.
